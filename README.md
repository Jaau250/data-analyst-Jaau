**#Project Description**: With numbers being a new way of life, complex and elaborate analysis techniques become necessary to gain insights that can be implemented. This report explains the step-by-step processes in managing and analyzing the City of Vancouver-issued building permit  dataset using tools such as AWS Glue DataBrew.
 
**#Project Title**: Building permit issued by the City of Vancouver 

 
**#Tools and Technology**: AWS Services- S3, AWS Glue, AWS Glue DataBrew, Cloudwatch
 
**#Deliverables**: Design and implementation of a data analytic platform 

 Descriptive analysis involves summarizing and presenting data to provide insight into the dataset's characteristics. 

Analyzing building permit issuance by building type

**#Data ingestion**: The process of moving data from unusual places and storing it in one central repository for processing and storing. 

Data ingestion Figure 1. Draw.io: The components of the diagram include Amazon s3 bucket, where the raw data is stored to be processed.  

  

**#Data profiling**: 
Figure 2: The process of fixing or removing incorrect, incomplete, or duplicate data from a dataset. The AWS service used as AWS Glue Data Brew. 

Data profiling figure: Draw.io  

 

**#Data Cleaning**: Draw .io Removing incompatible or incorrect data sets. 

 

 

 

 

Data Pipeline design: The process of creating a system for moving data from its source to its destination while also transforming and optimizing it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Processes using AWS services  

Step 1: Descriptive analysis question  

 
What is the count of permits issued by buildings  

Step 2: Data ingestion into S3 bucket 

 

Step 4 Data profiling

Exploratory analysis: is an analysis approach that identifies general patterns in the data.  

The exploratory question being answered here are: Which location has the highest value of permit issued
